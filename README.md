## I'm lazy

This is a personal project I've launched in 2016 in collaboration with my friend Janos. It uses CoffeeScript and a couple of other outdates building tools. I will eventually refactor this to typescript or ES6, but I'm kind of busy at the moment. If you want to give it a head start, please submit a PR.

## TODO
update sass dependencies
